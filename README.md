# eng-app
Opinionated Application Client framework to rapidly build enterprise level web clients connected to Rest services. 

Based on Angular.


# Short Description

Angular it's a great framework it gives you the basis to build beautiful client side applications.

But you have to take a lot of decisions to build a complete app.

Eng-app try to take some of these decisions for you and gives you a solid basis on wich you app can be built with minimal effort.

If you have some experience with desktop app we could say that eng-app is to Angular what Netbeans Platform (or Eclipse RCP if you prefer) is to Swing (or SWT). (n.b. i mean not the netbeans or eclipse ide but the platform and the RCP i.e. the open source frameworks/libraries over witch many probucts are built).
